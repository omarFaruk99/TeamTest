## **New Technology**
The project will be built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack** for performance optimization. For state management, we will implement **Redux**.

### **Why Redux?**
Redux is a great choice for our **Rental Marketplace for Gadgets** project because it efficiently manages state, especially as the application scales. Given that our project will include features such as searching, filtering, user authentication, and cart management, Redux ensures data remains organized and accessible across all components without prop drilling.
### **Benefits of Using Redux:**
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces unnecessary re-renders by optimizing state updates.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to expand the application without messy state handling.
- **Predictability:** Centralized state management ensures consistency and easier debugging.
- **Simplified API Handling:** Manages API responses and caching efficiently to reduce redundant requests.
- **Better Maintainability:** Enhances project structure, making future modifications and debugging simpler.

By integrating Redux, we aim to enhance the **efficiency, reliability, and maintainability** of my project, ensuring smooth state transitions and an improved user experience.
